# Rapid-Fire Dev Quiz

A sleek, fast, and lightweight quiz app built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created for the hackathon CodeOlympics with strict constraints, focusing on pure performance, reliability, and zero dependencies.

## üöÄ About The Project

This isn't just another quiz app. It's an exercise in constraint-driven development. The goal was to create a fully functional, reliable, and engaging user experience using only vanilla web technologies, all while adhering to strict line count and performance budgets.

The app, "Nursery Coder," presents users with 5 rapid-fire questions about web development basics. Each question is on a 12-second timer, pushing the user to think fast. At the end, it displays a score and a random fun coding fact.

### Features

* **Zero Dependencies:** Built with 100% pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* **Rapid-Fire Timer:** A 12-second timer for each question adds a fun challenge.
* **Stacked Card UI:** A smooth, app-like card-stack interface.
* **Instant Feedback:** Options turn green or red immediately upon selection.
* **Randomized Content:** Questions are shuffled and a random coding fact is shown at the end of each round.

    * **Performance:** Every user action completes in well under 2 seconds.
    * **No External Libraries:** 100% free of any external libraries or frameworks.
* **Error Handling:** Includes robust input validation (e.g., preventing double-clicks, handling timeouts) for a crash-free experience.
* **Real Utility:** Provides a fun and genuinely useful tool for developers to quickly test their basic knowledge.
