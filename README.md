# Rapid-Fire Dev Quiz

A sleek, fast, and lightweight quiz app built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created for the **CodeOlympics** hackathon, focusing on pure performance, reliability, and an API-driven dynamic experience.

## üöÄ About The Project

This isn't just another quiz app. It's an exercise in constraint-driven development. The goal was to create a fully functional, reliable, and engaging user experience using only vanilla web technologies, all while adhering to strict line count and performance budgets.

The app, "Nursery Coder," presents users with 5 rapid-fire questions from a **choice of dynamic categories**. Each question is on a 12-second timer, pushing the user to think fast. At the end, it displays a score and a **random, real-time coding quote** fetched from an API.

### Features

* **Zero Installable Dependencies:** Built with 100% pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* **Dynamic Categories:** Choose from multiple quiz categories (Computers, Film, Anime, or Random) loaded on the fly from the Open Trivia Database.
* **Dynamic Quotes:** Get a new, unique coding quote from an API at the end of every quiz.
* **Rapid-Fire Timer:** A 12-second timer for each question adds a fun challenge.
* **Stacked Card UI:** A smooth, app-like card-stack interface.
* **Instant Feedback:** Options turn green or red immediately upon selection.
* **Fully Responsive:** Designed to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üèÜ Hackathon Constraints

This project was built as a solo entry and successfully adheres to the following rules:

* **Functional Software:** All features work reliably with no broken parts or undefined behavior.
* **Constraint Compliance:**
    * **Line Limit:** The entire codebase (HTML, CSS, JS) is under 500 lines.
    * **Performance:** Every user action completes in well under 2 seconds.
    * **No Frameworks:** 100% free of any external UI libraries or frameworks (like React, Vue, etc.).
* **Error Handling:** Includes robust input validation (e.g., preventing double-clicks, handling timeouts, API fetch fallbacks) for a crash-free experience.
* **Real Utility:** Provides a fun and genuinely useful tool for users to quickly test their knowledge across various topics.
